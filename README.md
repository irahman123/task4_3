Lab 1 # Task 4

Tasks Completed: 

There is a Backend server using Node.JS and express.
The backend server is connected to a database MySQL. 
In the database created a table with the following attributes:

    -Id
    -Temperature
    -Timestamp

There are many rows with different temperatures to the database.

Created a simple webpage that will display a table with the latest 5 measurements.
Used an AJAX request towardsthe backend to fetch only the temperature data and then update the page with the latest 5 measurements every 60 seconds.


**// here I added mysql files ,(copied from xampp folder), I'm not sure, if it's ok for you to test.
